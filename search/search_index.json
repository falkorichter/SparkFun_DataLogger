Additionally, time zone support was moved out of the NTP system, and into the overall clock management subsystem.</p> <p>Internal JSON Buffer Limits \u2013 The initial firmware had fixed sizes for the internal JSON data buffers used for saving settings and log data output. These values are now user settable in the settings menu. This allows for larger buffer support, as well as reducing the internal buffers to what you need.</p> <p>Add Device IDs to the Device Names \u2013 As you add more devices to a DataLogger, it\u2019s difficult to match the device to the actual devices address.
